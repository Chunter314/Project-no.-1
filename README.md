The goal of this project is to provide an analysis of the air quality of the entirety of Nebraska to the client, UNMC Water, Climate, and Health Group. The client wants to understand how temperature, humidity, elevation, and location affect the quality of the air. The client has asked for 4 key tasks to be included in the final report; what are the five locations in Nebraska with the highest mean and median concentrations of VOC, PM 2.5 and PM 10.0, on what days did the maximum values occur and where did this maximums occur and what are some reasons, does humidity and temperature have a noticeable effect on air quality, and have there been any Air Quality health risks at any of the locations in the data provided by AirPurple for PM 2.5 and PM 10 based on the EPA’s ratings? 

The provided materials then gives the data analysis for these tasks that are given and explain the process that was taken to get to the goal. The data was then explained by using research and the results to explain causes for the decreases in air qualilty and the amount of pollutants in the air.
